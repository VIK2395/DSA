Graphs characteristics:

- directed/undirected;
- weighted/unweighted;
- positive/negative weight edges (if weighted);
==============================================================
- connected/disconnected graph (only applicable for undirected graphs)\
  https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-an-directed-non-connected-graph \
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory);
- has __connected components__ (only applicable for undirected graphs);
==============================================================
- strongly/unilaterally/weakly connected graph (only applicable for directed graphs)\
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-graph-is-strongly-unilaterally-or-weakly-connected/;
- has __strongly/weakly connected components__ (only applicable for directed graphs);
==============================================================
- cyclic/acyclic;
- positive/__negative__ cycle (if cyclic);
- dense(has many edges)/sparse(has many vertices);
