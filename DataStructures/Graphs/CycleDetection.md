Both directed and undirected graphs:
- DFS (connected/disconnected)\

  (using colors, directed) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-direct-graph-using-colors/
  

Directed grapths only:
- Kahnâ€™s algorithm for Topological Sorting (connected/disconnected)\
  (BFS) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph-using-bfs/ \

Undirected graph only:
