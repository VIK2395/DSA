Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space:\
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-auxiliary-space-and-space-complexity

Auxiliary Space => max memory allocated at a moment in stack (simultaneously). Like with max recursion stack height.\
NOT whole summary memmory allocated during the run as if no garbage collecting.\
