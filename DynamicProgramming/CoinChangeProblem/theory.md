There are 2 approaches in DP:
- Top-down (memoization) - recursive; we use memoization/cache to store results of solving recursive __overlapping or repeating subproblems__;
- Bottom-up (tabulation) - iterative; we split the problem to the lowest posible subproblems, and iteratively fill a DP table from the smallest subproblem to the problem.
