There are 3 types of recursion:

- Direct recursion
- Head recursion
- Tail recursion

__Tail recursion implemantation can always be re-written in a loop manner.__

In some programmming languages, while compiling __Tail-call optimization or tail-call elimination__ is performed(i.e. final code uses GOTO/JUMP instructions over a tail-recursive method, which is equivalent to a loop implementation)
