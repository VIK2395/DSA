- B-Three (M-way Balanced Tree) => a self-balancing tree; M-way tree where m - number of child nodes;
- B+ Tree (a variation of the B-tree that is optimized for use in file systems and databases; the leaf nodes are linked together in a linked list);
- AVL Tree => Georgy __Adelson-Velsky__ and Evgenii __Landis__ => a self-balancing binary search tree; M-way tree where m=2;
- Red-Black Tree => a self-balancing binary search tree, where each node has either the color of red or black; The colors of the nodes are used to make sure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertion and deletion;
- Splay Tree => a self-balancing binary search tree; Recently accessed elements are quicker to access again. It rearranges the tree so that the particular elements are placed at the root of the tree for quicker search again;
- Treap Tree (Cartesian tree) => a self-balancing randomized binary search tree; combines properties of both a binary search tree and a heap;
