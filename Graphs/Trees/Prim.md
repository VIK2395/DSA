https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm

- A greedy algorithm that finds a __minimum spanning tree__ for a __weighted undirected connected graph__. Works with __both positive and negative edges__.
  It is important to note that both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are not suitable for graphs with negative cycles, as they cannot find a spanning tree for such graphs (ChatGPT).
