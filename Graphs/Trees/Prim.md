Primâ€™s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm

- A greedy algorithm that finds a __minimum spanning tree__ for a __weighted undirected connected graph__. Works with __both positive and negative edges__.
  It is important to note that both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are not suitable for graphs with negative cycles, as they cannot find a spanning tree for such graphs (ChatGPT).
  __Works with cycles__.

Idea uder the hood:\
https://www.programiz.com/dsa/prim-algorithm
1. Init costs store, select a random start vertex, set its cost 0, other vertices cost infinity;
2. Select current min cost vertex; mark as visited;
3. Calc and update costs of its (not visited) neighbors;
4. Repeat step 2-3 until all vertices are visited;

__A vertex cost is the cost of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex.__
