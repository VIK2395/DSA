Depth-first search(DFS) is a __recursive__ algorithm that uses the backtracking principle.\
__So, any recursion is always Dfs.__ Traverse branch by branch; has recursive and loop implementations(with sctack).\
Algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.\
Time Complexity O(vertices + edges);

Has 3 three traversal approaches:
- Pre-order https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/?envType=list&envId=ob9rj7ig;
- In-order https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/?envType=list&envId=ob9rj7ig;
- Post-order https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/?envType=list&envId=ob9rj7ig;

*Here backtracking is used for traversal. In this traversal first, the deepest node is visited and then backtracks to its parent node\
if no sibling of that node exists*.\
